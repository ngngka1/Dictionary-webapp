A web application that provides general functions of a learner dictionary, such as: <br>

1. Dictionary<br>
2. Thesaurus<br>
3. Translator<br>
4. Word Quiz (WIP)<br>

Word Quiz will ask questions about random vocabularies, mainly extracted from words in the search history stored in database, maybe AI will be involved in creating questions (when I pay for openAI api)
